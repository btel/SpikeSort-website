Initial version of SpikeSort was programmed by Bartosz as a part of
his PhD project. In 2011 he was joined by Dmytro who implemented
additional features and tested the framework.

We thank our supervisors Gabriel Curio, Andreas Herz and Richard
Kempter for supporting us in the production of this software.

During the development of SpikeSort we were financially supported by Deutsche
Frorschungsgeselchaft as a part of SFB 618 "Theoretical Biology"
project B4.
