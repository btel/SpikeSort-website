   Spike Features panel is a grid of two-dimensional projections
   (mosaic plot) of all features (here only projection on the first

   Spike Browser superimposes the identified spikes on the raw
   recordings allowing for quick visual validation of the sorting
   results. The four traces represent different contacts of the same
   tetrode.
